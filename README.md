# Tree_Graphs
Implementation of different Tree and Graphs

Here, In this Repository, We have implemented Insert/Delete/Search Methods in a Binary Search Tree, Insert/Search in AVL and RED BLACK Tree.

Also, Prims Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree and Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the Single Source Shortest Path in the Graph.

# Execution Procedure
In each Method, there are 3 folders, namely,
            include : Contains the Header .h file which needs to be included in the .c files.
            src     : Contains the source Code for each method being implemented.
            make    : Contains the makefile and the make library files.
